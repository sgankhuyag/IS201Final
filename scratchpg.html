        <h1>About Sugar</h1>
        <p class="intro">
            Sugar is about two years old, and has been with me and my family for about a year and a half. 
            He is a pure-bred Samoyed, a breed specifically created to survive the cold temperatures of Siberia. Unfortunately, in the desert known as Utah, Sugar is unable to enjoy the snow as much as he would like.
            Every time winter comes around, Sugar plays in the snow as much as he can before he has to go inside after a walk.

        <p class="toys">
            From the beginning, Sugar has loved playing with toys. A little <em>too</em> much.
            When we first bought him some toys, we thought that he would be able to grow up next to them and we could compare how big he was as a puppy to how big he is now. 
            However, within a month, or even a couple of days, the toys we got sugar would be mangled and destroyed with no hope of salvation.
            We've learned to give him more durable toys now.

        <p class="toys2">Here's a simple graph to explains how long Sugar's toys have lasted, along with what kind of toy and how durable they were out of a rating of 10.</p>

        <p class="cuddling">
            Since Sugar sports a thick, hairy coat, he doesn't like laying on anything other than the cold, hard floor. 
            We made a huge bed for him to sleep on, and he never touched it, even as a puppy.
            He also doesn't like cuddling, unless he's the one doing it. 
            I've found out that whenever I'm cooking or sitting at the dinner table, anywhere on the hard floor, Sugar will come up and lay against my leg. 
            Turns out, he can be a pretty affectionate dog when he wants to be.

        <p class="bath">
            The first day we got Sugar he was <em>really</em> stinky, so we gave him a bath. 
            That was the day we realized Sugar hated baths. It's been nearly two years since then, and every time I give him a bath(or shower), he absolutely hates it. 
            <br>
            Not only does he hate baths, he hates getting groomed as well. 
            Brushing a big, fluffy dog like him takes at least an hour, and since he squirms and tries to run away half the time, it takes nearly three hours to fully groom him.

            ...and deal with his aversion to being clean
        </h3>
        <br><br>
        <ol class="bathtime">
            <li>Bath/Shower</li>
            <ul>
                <li>To give Sugar a bath, we first make sure the bathroom is prepped completely with his towels and shampoo/conditioner. He's big enough to jump out of the bathtub and has a history of wetting himself in the bathroom, so to the best and fastest way to (start to)give him a bath is starting immediately the second he's in the tub.</li>
                <li>Getting him inside the bathtub is probably the easiest part. All you need to do is pick him up straight out of his cage and walk to the bathroom. The real struggle is keeping him inside the bathtub while simultaneously trying to bathe him.</li>
                <li>We like buying two-in-one shampoo conditioner so we don't have to work so much on Sugar than we need to, but bathing him still takes an hour. It takes a lot of time to work the shampoo into his coat and undercoat, and doing that while trying to keep him from jumping out of the bath leaves you soaked and tired.</li>
                <li>Rinsing him after soaping him all up is also a challenge. He hates water, no matter how many treats we try to distract him with, so submerging him in water is out of the question. I usually get a plastic cup and pour water on him one cup at a time. It's the best way I've been able to get the soap out of his hair.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Drying</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Sugar is really eager to get out of the tub and into a towel, but his cooperative happiness lasts about ten seconds before he starts squirming once more.</li>
                <li>We use two towels to take most of the water from his coat, but we finish the process with a vaccum with the hose plugged into the opposite end. It's the strongest blow-drier we have and it has a longer reach than the handheld hair-dryer, which is very useful once Sugar starts trying to run away from getting dried.</li>
                <li>After about fifteen minutes, Sugar is nearly fully dry. We try to dry him as quickly as we can so we can fulfill the next step of the grooming regime-taking him outside.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Bathroom Break</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Fully dry or not, we take Sugar outside to use the bathroom.</li>
                <li>Once Sugar is out of the bathtub the next thing on our minds is getting him outside and clearning his bowels. Somehow, after every time he takes a bath, he needs to pee really bad, and he can't hold it for a long time. </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Cleanup</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Unsurprisingly, the bathroom is a mess after Sugar's done with it. Hair and water is all over the floor and the vaccum cleaner is also floating around in the bathroom.</li>
                <li>It takes a while to clean up, so this step is either put off until Sugar is brushed or one person cleans the bathroom while the other takes Sugar outside/brushes Sugar.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Brushing (and more)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The next thing that Sugar hates the most! Getting brushed. We use three different brushes of varying skills that we found at Walmart.</li>
                <li>Unlike during a bath, Sugar is easily distracted with the promise of treats, so we usually sit a tub of cheerios nearby and whenever Sugar is being difficult, shake the tub and watch him become a very compliant dog.</li>
                <li>Even with treats, Sugar's coat is very thick and long, so to brush him it takes another hour or so. To brush him efficiently, we have to lay him down and separate a small section of his fur to brush at a time.</li>
                <li>After brushing him, we clip his nails(at least, try to, he hates that too), trim his coat around his paws and legs, put his collar back on, and give him some treats.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
